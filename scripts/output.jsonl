In 2021, Durant was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. As a member of the U.S. men's national team, Durant has won three gold medals in the Olympics (2012, 2016, and 2020) and is the leading scorer in Team USA's men's Olympic basketball history. He also won gold at the 2010 FIBA World Championship.\nDurant was a heavily recruited high school prospect widely regarded as the second-best player in his class. He played one season of college basketball for the Texas Longhorns, where he won numerous year-end awards and became the first freshman to be named Naismith College Player of the Year. Durant was selected as the second overall pick by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 2007 NBA draft. He played nine seasons with the franchise, which became the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2008, before signing with the Golden State Warriors in 2016, winning consecutive NBA championships and NBA Finals MVP Awards in 2017 and 2018. After sustaining an Achilles injury in the 2019 NBA Finals, Durant joined the Brooklyn Nets as a free agent that summer. Following disagreements with the Nets' front office, he requested a trade during the 2022 offseason and was traded to the Suns the following year.\nOff the court, Durant is one of the highest-earning basketball players in the world, due in part to endorsement deals with companies such as Foot Locker and Nike. He has developed a reputation for philanthropy and regularly leads the league in All-Star votes and jersey sales. In 2018, Durant was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world. In recent years, he has contributed to The Players' Tribune as both a photographer and writer.

Durant has a sister, Brianna, and two brothers, Tony and Rayvonne.\nDurant and his siblings grew up in Prince George's County, Maryland, on the eastern outskirts of Washington, D.C. He was unusually tall from a young age, and reached 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m) in height while still in middle school (age 10\u201312). Growing up, Durant wanted to play for his favorite team, the Toronto Raptors, which included his favorite player, Vince Carter. Durant played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for several teams in the Maryland area and was teammates with future NBA players Michael Beasley, Greivis V\u00e1squez, and Ty Lawson, the first of whom Durant remains friends with to this day.\n During this time, he began wearing #35 as his jersey number in honor of his AAU coach, Charles Craig, who was murdered at the age of 35.\nAfter playing two years of high school basketball at National Christian Academy and one year at Oak Hill Academy, Durant transferred to Montrose Christian School for his senior year, growing 5 inches (13 cm) before the start of the season and beginning the year at 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m).\nPrior to the start of the season, Durant committed to the University of Texas at Austin.

In the climax season of the Warriors\u2019 dynasty, they won their fifth NBA championship, setting the best postseason record in NBA history by going 16\u20131. This Warriors team is widely considered one of the greatest teams in NBA history. They entered the season as runners-up in the 2016 NBA Finals, after a record breaking regular-season in 2015\u201316. With the landmark acquisition of free agent and 7-time NBA All-Star Kevin Durant in the offseason, the Warriors were hailed as a \"superteam\" by the media and fans, forming a new All-Star \"Fantastic Four\" of Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. The Warriors broke over 20 NBA records on their way to equaling their 2014\u201315 regular-season record of 67\u201315, their second most wins in franchise history.\nIn the postseason, Golden State clinched the top seed in the playoffs for the third successive year. The Warriors swept the Portland Trail Blazers 4\u20130 in the first round, the Utah Jazz 4\u20130 in the Western Conference semi-finals and the San Antonio Spurs 4\u20130 in the Western Conference Finals. The Warriors claimed their fifth NBA Championship by beating the Cleveland Cavaliers 4\u20131 in the NBA Finals, the first time in NBA history two teams have met for a third consecutive year. Golden State became the first team ever to start 15\u20130 in the playoffs and their fifteen straight wins were the most consecutive postseason wins in NBA history.

The Warriors were the only team with multiple players named to the All-NBA Team this season, with Curry, Durant and Green all selected.

It is also the first full season under the ownership group led by Mat Ishbia and Justin Ishbia after the brothers purchased the team on February 8, 2023. It was the first season since 1971\u201372 without Al McCoy broadcasting any games. He announced his retirement after the 2023 NBA playoffs. It also was the first season the Suns moved their broadcasting services from Bally Sports Arizona (previously named FSN Arizona and Fox Sports Arizona) back in 2003 to multiple Arizona-based TV networks broadcasting games through Gray Television owned local networks KTVK, Arizona's Family Sports via multiple local networks, and KOLD-TV (in the Tucson region) alongside an over-the-top subscription service called \"Suns Live\" that was created by Kiswe. This was the first season since 2018\u201319 without head coach Monty Williams after a second straight disappointing second-round exit. He was fired on May 13, 2023, despite having the team's first winning record as head coach since Jeff Hornacek, the first overall winning record and first coach to make the playoffs since Alvin Gentry, their first NBA Coach of the Year Award winner since Mike D'Antoni, and their first head coach since Paul Westphal (and third overall alongside John MacLeod) to reach the NBA Finals, with one season left on his original deal.\nOn June 6, the Suns hired Frank Vogel (a championship-winning head coach in the 2020 NBA Finals with the Los Angeles Lakers) over finalists Doc Rivers (who won the NBA Finals in 2008 with the Boston Celtics) and associate coach Kevin Young (who kept his job with a pay raise in mind), with his new coaching staff made official on June 21. On June 24, the Suns traded with the Washington Wizards to acquire 3-time All-Star shooting guard Bradley Beal (alongside Jordan Goodwin and Isaiah Todd) in exchange for 12-time All-Star point guard Chris Paul, shooting guard Landry Shamet, six second-rounders, four first-round pick swaps, and cash, though the deal was later considered a part of a three-way deal with the Indiana Pacers. This became the team's second trade for a star player in four months after trading for 13-time NBA All-Star and 2-time NBA Finals MVP Kevin Durant during the previous season in February. During the month of July, the Suns made three more trades to gain more immediate draft capital on their end. On September 27, before training camp, the Suns traded center Deandre Ayton and rookie Toumani Camara to the Portland Trail Blazers in a three-way deal that sent 7-time All-Star Trail Blazers guard Damian Lillard to the Milwaukee Bucks in exchange for Milwaukee shooting guard Grayson Allen, Portland center Jusuf Nurki\u0107, and Portland guards Nassir Little and Keon Johnson (the last of whom was waived before the start of the regular season). The Suns then made a three-team trade at the February 8, 2024 trade deadline with the Brooklyn Nets and Memphis Grizzlies to acquire Nets forward Royce O'Neale and Grizzlies forward David Roddy alongside a 2026 first-round pick swap with Memphis in exchange for mostly free agent acquisitions from earlier in the season in Keita Bates-Diop, Jordan Goodwin, Yuta Watanabe, Chimezie Metu, and three of the Suns' four remaining second-round picks they had at the time, and also signed veteran free agents Thaddeus Young and Isaiah Thomas (the latter of whom had played with the Suns during the 2014\u201315 season) in a final attempt to bolster up their roster for the season.\nThroughout this season, the Suns dealt with constant challenges that had them performing below expectations early on, such as the delayed debut of their Big Three of Devin Booker, Kevin Durant, and Bradley Beal together until December 13, 2023 (with them not even seeing consistent playing time together until the end of 2023 and the start of 2024) alongside injuries and poor fourth quarter"}

The Olympics were delayed a year until 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was the fourth consecutive Olympic gold medal for the Americans. Team USA qualified for the Olympics by finishing as one of the top two teams from the Americas at the FIBA Basketball World Cup in 2019.\nThe U.S. saw two Olympic gold medal winners in Kevin Durant (2012, 2016) and Draymond Green (2016) return, while 10 other players made their Olympic debuts. Unlike the 2019 World Cup team that finished in seventh place with a team of traditional centers and limited shooting, the Olympic team featured multi-positional players and adept shooters. After the disappointing World Cup, in which only four of the initial 35 candidates were on the final roster, star players began openly expressing an interest in joining the Olympic team. While other countries had a core roster that has played together for years in multiple international tournaments, the U.S. team changed every year.\nComplicating the decision for National Basketball Association (NBA) players to commit to the Olympics was the pandemic's impact on the league's schedule. The 2020 NBA Finals did not end until October 11, 2020. Although the start of the 2020\u201321 NBA season was delayed, it still began 71 days after the prior Finals, as opposed to the usual 100 days or more. The season was condensed with many back-to-back games. While the 2021 Finals were scheduled to allow players time to travel to Tokyo, the playoffs were ongoing while other countries were practicing. The delayed season cut into Team USA's time to gel and learn to play as a team. Moreover, three team members played in the Finals, which did not conclude until July 20, and they missed all of training camp and the pre-Olympic exhibitions in Las Vegas.

He made his head coaching debut for Team USA on the 2019 World Cup team in China. In February 2020, USA Basketball announced an initial list of 44 finalists for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled for July\u2013Aug 2020. After the Games were postponed until 2021, the list of finalists was expanded to 57 to remain flexible. By the end of the 2020\u201321 NBA season, a number of All-Star level players were either injured or requiring extended recovery time for the upcoming season. Olympic training camp took place while the 2021 NBA playoffs were ongoing. No tryouts were held, with decisions on the final 12-man roster based in part on player health and availability.\n\nAn initial 12-man roster was named with a combined 37 NBA All-Star selections, led by Kevin Durant with 11. He entered the 2020 Games ranked second in U.S. men's Olympic basketball history with 311 career points, needing just 25 more to match Carmelo Anthony's record of 336. A two-time Olympic gold medalist from the 2012 and 2016 teams, Durant was joined on the squad by one other gold medal winner, his 2016 teammate Draymond Green, who he also played with on the Golden State Warriors. Also committing to the team were four of the NBA's top 10 scorers from the 2020\u201321 season with Bradley Beal (31.1 points per game), Damian Lillard (28.8), Zach LaVine (27.4) and Jayson Tatum (26.4).

The Thunder are the only team in the major professional North American sports leagues based in the state of Oklahoma. Oklahoma City previously hosted the New Orleans Hornets for two seasons following devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.\nThe team was originally established as the Seattle SuperSonics, an expansion team that joined the NBA for the 1967\u201368 season. The SuperSonics relocated from Seattle to Oklahoma City on July 3, 2008, after a settlement was reached between the ownership group led by Clay Bennett and lawmakers in Seattle following a lawsuit. In Seattle, the SuperSonics qualified for the NBA playoffs 22 times, won their division six times, advanced to three NBA Finals, and won the 1979 NBA Championship.\nIn Oklahoma City, the Thunder qualified for their first playoff berth during the 2009\u201310 season.

{"page_content": "Kendrick Le'Dale Perkins (born November 10, 1984) is a former American professional basketball player who is a sports analyst for ESPN. He entered the NBA directly out of high school and played for the Boston Celtics, Oklahoma City Thunder, Cleveland Cavaliers, and New Orleans Pelicans, winning the NBA Championship in 2008 with the Celtics.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nPerkins was born in Nederland, Texas and raised by his grandparents, who lived on a farm. His mother was shot and killed by her best friend when Kendrick turned five.  His father played professional basketball in New Zealand \u2014 where he stayed throughout \u2014 and never visited Perkins. Perkins went to a private Catholic school starting in sixth grade. Perkins' grandfather was very enthusiastic about sports, helping spark his competitive passion. In addition to basketball, Perkins also participated in pick-up football games as a defensive end, and baseball as a first baseman. Perkins stopped playing baseball in ninth grade, and gave up on football in tenth grade.\nPerkins first met LeBron James in the seventh grade when playing for Houston Hoops and competing against LeBron's Ohio Shooting Stars. Perkins later became friends with LeBron during his time at ABCD Camp where they were teammates on the Oakland Soldiers. During his time on the AAU circuit beginning in eighth grade, Perkins was ranked No. 3, LeBron at No. 1, and Chris Paul at No. 2. Perkins had his largest growth spurt from eighth grade to ninth grade, where he went from 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) to 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m), his current height. Perkins' first in-game dunk was in the seventh grade.\n\n\n== High school career ==\nPerkins graduated from Clifton J. Ozen High School in Beaumont, Texas, in 2003. He led Ozen High to four consecutive district championships and one state championship during his high school career. Averaging 27.5 points, 16.4 rebounds and 7.8 blocked shots a game as a senior, he led Ozen to a 33\u20131 record, with the only loss being a 66\u201354 setback to Fort Worth Dunbar in the state 4A championship game. After his senior season in 2003, Perkins was selected to the McDonald's All-American Game.\nConsidered a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Perkins was listed as the No. 3 center and the No. 6 player in the nation in 2003. He had originally committed to Memphis, but opted instead to make the jump to the NBA straight out of high school.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\n\n\n=== Boston Celtics (2003\u20132011) ===\n\nThe 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m) center was drafted in the first round with the 27th pick of the 2003 NBA draft by the Memphis Grizzlies, but was immediately traded along with Marcus Banks to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Troy Bell and Dahntay Jones, who had been selected by the Celtics in the same draft.\nDuring the 2004\u201305 season, Perkins received more playing time than he did his rookie season, and became known as one of the tougher players on the Celtics. He had a limited role during the regular season and playoffs as the team's \"enforcer\". Perkins was involved in an unusual scenario in the final seconds of regulation in Game 6 of the 2005 Eastern Conference first round against Indiana. Paul Pierce was ejected but Pierce was owed free throws because he had been fouled before the ejection. Under NBA rules, Indiana coach Rick Carlisle chose to select Perkins (who had not played in the game) off the bench to shoot the crucial free throws (the game was tied). Perkins missed both, indirectly leading the game going into overtime, in which the Celtics eventually won.\n\nAfter marked improvements during summer training and practice, Perkins earned more playing time from coach Doc Rivers during the 2005\u201306 season. He played some of the best games of his career in 2006, repeatedly reaching double figures in points and rebounds. After the trade of Mark Blount to the Minnesota Timberwolves, Perkins became the undisputed starting center for the Celtics, although he was already sharing starting time before Blount's departure.

{"page_content": "The Golden State Warriors are an American professional basketball team based in San Francisco. The Warriors compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. Founded in 1946 in Philadelphia, the Warriors moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1962 and took the city's name, before changing its geographic moniker to Golden State in 1971. The club plays its home games at the Chase Center.\nThe Warriors won the inaugural Basketball Association of America (BAA) championship in 1947, and won again in 1956, led by Hall of Fame trio Paul Arizin, Tom Gola, and Neil Johnston. After the trade of star Wilt Chamberlain in January 1965, the team finished the 1964\u201365 season with the NBA's worst record (17\u201363). Their rebuilding period was brief due in large part to the Warriors' drafting of Rick Barry four months after the trade. In 1975, star players Barry and Jamaal Wilkes powered the Warriors to their third championship, widely considered one of the biggest upsets in NBA history.\nThe team struggled in the 1980s, then became playoff regulars at the turn of the decade with stars Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, and Chris Mullin, nicknamed \"Run TMC\". Led by Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green, the team returned to championship glory in 2015, with defensive swingman Andre Iguodala being named Finals MVP. In 2016, the Warriors set the record for best regular season record at 73\u20139 before losing the Finals to the Cleveland Cavaliers (against whom they played a record four straight finals) and becoming the first team to lose a series after leading 3\u20131 in the Finals. After signing former MVP Kevin Durant, the team won back-to-back championships in 2017 and 2018 (Durant winning both Finals MVPs). They lost the 2019 Finals to the Toronto Raptors, a series which saw Durant and Thompson suffer serious Achilles and ACL injuries, respectively; Durant left that off-season. After missing the playoffs the following two seasons, the Warriors returned to the playoffs with a healthy Thompson and a new supporting cast that included All-Star Andrew Wiggins and key scorer Jordan Poole; they defeated the Boston Celtics in the 2022 Finals, where Curry won his first Finals MVP. The Warriors' dynasty has seen the team win four titles in eight seasons, as well as reach five consecutive Finals from 2015 to 2019 (six Finals in eight years); Curry, Green, Thompson, and Iguodala were on all four 21st century championship teams, Shaun Livingston and Kevon Looney were on three each.\nNicknamed the \"Dubs\" as a shortening of \"W's\", the Warriors hold several NBA records: best regular season, most wins in a season (regular season and postseason combined), and best postseason run. Curry and Thompson are generally considered among the greatest backcourts of all time. The Warriors have the third most NBA championships and have the third most Finals appearances; only the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics have more. Wilt Chamberlain and Stephen Curry have been named the NBA's MVPs while playing for the Warriors, for a total of three MVP awards.\n\n\n== Franchise history ==\n\n\n=== 1946\u20131962: Early years in Philadelphia ===\n\nThe Warriors were founded in 1946 as the Philadelphia Warriors, a charter member of the Basketball Association of America. They were owned by Peter A. Tyrrell, who also owned the Philadelphia Rockets of the American Hockey League. Tyrrell hired Eddie Gottlieb, a longtime basketball promoter in the Philadelphia area, as coach and general manager. The owners named the team after the Philadelphia Warriors, an old basketball team who played in the American Basketball League in 1925.\nLed by early scoring sensation Joe Fulks, the team won the championship in the league's inaugural 1946\u201347 season by defeating the Chicago Stags, four games to one. The NBA, which was created by a 1949 merger, officially recognizes that as its own first championship. Gottlieb bought the team in 1951.\nThe Warriors won "}

{"page_content": "The 2017\u201318 Golden State Warriors season was the 72nd season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA), and its 56th in the San Francisco Bay Area. The Warriors entered the season as the defending NBA champions and repeated, beating the Cleveland Cavaliers 4\u20130 in the Finals. It was the first time in NBA history and in North America's four major professional sports leagues that two teams had met to compete for a Championship for a fourth consecutive year. It was the Warriors' third championship in four years, and sixth overall. Golden State won the Pacific Division title and Western Conference Championship for the fourth consecutive season. In the playoffs, the Warriors defeated the San Antonio Spurs in the First Round 4\u20131 and the New Orleans Pelicans 4\u20131 in the Semi-finals. They beat the top-seeded Houston Rockets 4\u20133 in the Western Conference Finals.\nThe Warriors finished second in the Western Conference with a record of 58\u201324, their fifth most wins in franchise history. Golden State set the NBA record of 16 consecutive home wins in the playoffs, surpassing the 1990\u201391 Chicago Bulls. Stephen Curry set the NBA record for three-pointers made in an NBA Finals game with nine. Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson were all named to the All-Star Game, the first time in NBA history that a team has had four All-Stars in consecutive seasons, and just the ninth time in NBA history a single team has had four players in the game. Curry was named captain, being the leading vote getter from the Western Conference. The Warriors ended the regular season with a slew of injuries to all four of their All-Stars, including an MCL sprain for Curry that kept him out for six weeks, and lost ten of their last seventeen games. For the first time since the 2013\u201314 season, they did not clinch first place for home-court advantage for the playoffs and failed to win 60 games for the first time under Steve Kerr. This season marked David West's final season in the NBA. He retired on August 30, 2018, having won two NBA championships with the Warriors.\n\n\n== Draft picks ==\n\nThe 2017 NBA draft was held on June 22, 2017, at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. The Warriors did not have a pick, but acquired the Chicago Bulls's 38th pick in the second round for cash, having chosen power forward Jordan Bell out of Oregon. After the draft, the team signed Bell's former Oregon teammate, Chris Boucher, to a two-way contract.\n\n\n== Preseason ==\nOn July 1, 2017, Stephen Curry agreed to re-sign with Golden State on a super-max five-year/$201m deal. The Warriors also resigned Kevin Durant, and their veteran core of Shaun Livingston, David West, Andre Iguodala, Zaza Pachulia and JaVale McGee.

{"page_content": "A superteam in the National Basketball Association (NBA) is a team that is viewed as significantly more talented than the rest of the teams in the league. There is no official distinction, but it is generally viewed as a team that has at least 3 Hall of Fame, All-Star, and/or All-NBA caliber players that join forces to pursue an NBA championship.\n\n\n== Notable superteams ==\n\n\n=== 1968\u20131973: Los Angeles Lakers ===\n\nThe earliest example of a superteam without it naturally being developed is when superstar Wilt Chamberlain joined fellow superstar players Jerry West and Elgin Baylor, on the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1968 offseason. This trio reached the NBA Finals on two separate occasions, both times losing in a game seven to the Boston Celtics in 1969, and the New York Knicks in 1970. The Lakers would win the championship in 1972 while recording what was at the time the best regular season record ever at 69\u201313, but Baylor retired early in the season due to injuries. Nevertheless, Baylor earned a championship ring for his services to the team. Meanwhile, the Lakers reacquired Gail Goodrich from the Phoenix Suns in 1970, who went on to become a four-time All-Star while with the Lakers himself. Wilt Chamberlain later retired in 1973, ending what can be considered the first superteam in NBA history; West later retired himself in 1974, while Goodrich ended up leaving the Lakers again (this time in free agency) in 1976.\n\n\n=== 1979\u20131989: Los Angeles Lakers ===\n\nThe Lakers would once again create a new superteam of their own by the end of the 1970's. The makings of it first began when the Lakers traded with the Milwaukee Bucks in 1975, back when Gail Goodrich was still with the Lakers, after multiple negative remarks relating to the city of Milwaukee happened during the 1974\u201375 season. Then, in 1977, the Lakers acquired former Golden State Warriors All-Star and champion Jamaal Wilkes in free agency after the Warriors declined to match the Lakers' offer for him. However, it wasn't until 1979 where the superteam rub first began for the Lakers when they were not only purchased by Jerry Buss from owner Jack Kent Cooke, but also drafted Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson with the #1 pick they acquired via trade with the New Orleans Jazz before the 1979 NBA draft began and then acquired former ABA MVP and All-Star Spencer Haywood from the recently rebranded Utah Jazz in exchange for Adrian Dantley. Despite needing to replace coach Jack McKinney with Paul Westhead only 13 games into the 1979\u201380 season, the Lakers saw immediate success that season by not only creating a basketball phenomenon for the 1980's decade called the Showtime Lakers, but also by winning the 1980 NBA Finals over the Philadelphia 76ers, with rookie Magic Johnson winning Finals MVP honors that year. The 1979\u201380 Lakers season became the focal point for the first season of HBO's \"Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty\".\nAfter that season, Haywood was kicked off the team for cocaine problems, Johnson had injury problems in his left knee, and the Lakers were knocked out of the first round the following season to the eventual Western Conference champion Houston Rockets. However, the Lakers bounced back by not only firing coach Paul Westhead and replacing him with former Lakers player Pat Riley as head coach for the rest of the 1980's, but also by acquiring former All-Star and MVP Bob McAdoo from the New Jersey Nets on a Christmas Eve trade in 1981. This led to the Lakers getting their second NBA Finals championship in 1982 during the Showtime era, as well as later acquiring star forward James Worthy as the #1 pick in the 1982 NBA draft thanks to a previous trade with the Cleveland Cavaliers under Ted Stepien's ownership. With Worthy on their roster, the Lakers managed to make it at least to the NBA Finals in every season (later winning another NBA Finals championship in 1985) before losing the Western Conference Finals to the Houston Rockets in 1986 after both Jamaal Wilkes and Bob McA"}
